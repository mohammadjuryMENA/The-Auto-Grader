The key component is self-attention, which allows each position to attend to all other positions, learning which parts of the input are most relevant. They use multi-head attention to capture different types of relationships, positional encodings to retain sequence order, and have encoder-decoder structures (or encoder-only like BERT, decoder-only like GPT).

It characterizes how resource requirements scale with input size, focusing on the dominant term and ignoring constants. For example, O(n) means linear time, O(n²) quadratic, O(log n) logarithmic, and O(1) constant. This matters because it helps us compare algorithms independently of hardware, predict performance on large datasets, and make informed design decisions. An O(n²) algorithm might be fine for 100 items but terrible for 1 million. Common examples: binary search is O(log n), quicksort averages O(n log n), and nested loops are often O(n²).

A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process, sharing the process's memory and resources. Key differences: 1) Memory: Processes are isolated; threads share memory. 2) Communication: Inter-process communication (IPC) uses pipes, sockets, or message queues; threads use shared memory. 3) Overhead: Process creation/switching is expensive; threads are lighter. 4) Safety: Process crashes are isolated; thread crashes can bring down the process. 5) Concurrency: Both enable parallelism, but threads have faster context switching. Use processes when: you need isolation, running untrusted code, or want fault tolerance (microservices). Use threads when: sharing data frequently, need lightweight concurrency, or building real-time systems. Modern languages offer async/await as an alternative to threads for I/O-bound tasks. Python's GIL limits thread parallelism for CPU-bound work, favoring multiprocessing.\n\n**Rubric:** Grade for Technical Depth and Practical Guidance: Does the response demonstrate deep understanding and provide practical advice?\n\n**Evaluation:**\nScore: 5/5\n\nReasoning: Outstanding technical explanation with clear distinctions, multiple dimensions of comparison, practical decision criteria, modern alternatives, and language-specific considerations. Both theoretically sound and practically useful.",

    "text": "You are an AI Judge. Evaluate the following response based on the rubric and provide a score from 1-5 and detailed reasoning.\n\n**Prompt:** Explain the SOLID principles in software engineering.\n\n**Response:** SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles: 1) Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have one reason to change. Keep classes focused on a single concern. 2) Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Use abstraction and polymorphism to add features without changing existing code. 3) Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness. Child classes shouldn't break parent class contracts. 4) Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Create specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface. 5) Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not concretions. High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules. These principles reduce coupling, increase cohesion, and make code more maintainable, testable, and extensible. Example: Instead of a UserService depending on MySQLDatabase directly (violates DIP), it should depend on a Database interface.\n\n**Rubric:** Grade for Comprehensiveness and Clarity: Does the response thoroughly explain the concept with examples?\n\n**Evaluation:**\nScore: 5/5\n\nReasoning: Comprehensive coverage of all five principles with clear explanations, implications, benefits, and a concrete example.

    "text": "You are an AI Judge. Evaluate the following response based on the rubric and provide a score from 1-5 and detailed reasoning.\n\n**Prompt:** How do vaccines provide immunity?\n\n**Response:** Vaccines train the immune system to recognize and fight pathogens without causing disease. They work through several mechanisms: 1) Antigen presentation: Vaccines contain weakened, inactivated, or fragment of pathogens (antigens). 2) Immune recognition: Dendritic cells capture antigens and present them to T-cells. 3) B-cell activation: Helper T-cells activate B-cells, which differentiate into plasma cells producing specific antibodies. 4) Memory formation: Some B-cells and T-cells become memory cells, persisting for years or decades. 5) Rapid response: Upon future exposure, memory cells quickly recognize the pathogen and mount a swift, strong immune response before illness develops. Types include: live attenuated (weakened pathogen), inactivated (killed pathogen), subunit (protein fragments), mRNA (genetic instructions for cells to produce antigens), and vector-based. mRNA vaccines (like COVID-19) are revolutionary because they're faster to develop and don't contain actual pathogen material. Herd immunity occurs when enough people are vaccinated to prevent widespread transmission, protecting vulnerable individuals.\n\n**Rubric:** Grade for Scientific Accuracy and Depth: Is the explanation scientifically rigorous and comprehensive?\n\n**Evaluation:**\nScore: 5/5\n\nReasoning: Exceptional scientific explanation covering the complete immunological mechanism, specific cell types and processes, multiple vaccine types with modern examples, and broader public health concepts.

    "text": "You are an AI Judge. Evaluate the following response based on the rubric and provide a score from 1-5 and detailed reasoning.\n\n**Prompt:** What are the different database normalization forms and why do they matter?\n\n**Response:** Database normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. The main forms are: 1) First Normal Form (1NF): Eliminate repeating groups; each cell contains atomic values. No comma-separated lists. 2) Second Normal Form (2NF): Achieve 1NF and ensure non-key attributes fully depend on the entire primary key, not just part of it (relevant for composite keys). 3) Third Normal Form (3NF): Achieve 2NF and remove transitive dependencies—non-key attributes shouldn't depend on other non-key attributes. 4) Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): Stricter form of 3NF addressing certain anomalies with multiple candidate keys. 5) Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Eliminate multi-valued dependencies. Benefits: reduces storage, prevents update anomalies, ensures consistency, and makes the schema more maintainable. Trade-offs: Higher normal forms mean more joins, which can impact query performance. Sometimes strategic denormalization is used in read-heavy systems (data warehouses) for performance. Example: Storing customer address in customers table (normalized) vs. repeating it in every order (denormalized).\n\n**Rubric:** Grade for Technical Completeness: Does the response thoroughly explain the database concept?\n\n**Evaluation:**\nScore: 5/5\n\nReasoning: Comprehensive explanation of normalization forms with clear definitions, progression through forms, benefits, trade-offs, practical considerations, and concrete examples.

    "text": "You are an AI Judge. Evaluate the following response based on the rubric and provide a score from 1-5 and detailed reasoning.\n\n**Prompt:** Explain how gradient descent works in machine learning.\n\n**Response:** Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by iteratively adjusting model parameters. The process: 1) Start with random initial parameters (weights). 2) Calculate the loss function measuring prediction error. 3) Compute the gradient (partial derivatives) of the loss with respect to each parameter—this indicates the direction of steepest increase. 4) Update parameters by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient (toward minimum): θ_new = θ_old - α * ∇L, where α is the learning rate. 5) Repeat until convergence. Variants include: Batch GD (uses entire dataset per update—slow but stable), Stochastic GD (uses one sample—fast but noisy), and Mini-batch GD (uses small batches—balanced approach, most common). Challenges: choosing learning rate (too high causes oscillation, too low is slow), local minima, and saddle points. Advanced optimizers like Adam combine momentum and adaptive learning rates to improve convergence. Backpropagation computes gradients efficiently in neural networks using the chain rule.\n\n**Rubric:** Grade for Technical Accuracy and Comprehensiveness: Is the ML concept explained thoroughly and correctly?\n\n**Evaluation:**\nScore: 5/5\n\nReasoning: Excellent technical explanation covering the algorithm, mathematical formulation, variants, challenges, solutions, and connection to neural networks.

    "text": "You are an AI Judge. Evaluate the following response based on the rubric and provide a score from 1-5 and detailed reasoning.\n\n**Prompt:** How does public key cryptography work?\n\n**Response:** Public key cryptography (asymmetric encryption) uses a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The process: 1) Key generation: User generates a key pair using algorithms like RSA or ECC. The public key is shared openly; private key stays secret. 2) Encryption: Anyone can encrypt a message using the recipient's public key. 3) Decryption: Only the recipient can decrypt using their private key. This solves the key distribution problem—no need for secure channel to share keys. Applications: 1) Confidentiality: Encrypt messages. 2) Authentication: Digital signatures use private key to sign; anyone can verify with public key. 3) Key exchange: Protocols like Diffie-Hellman establish shared secrets. RSA security relies on difficulty of factoring large numbers; ECC (Elliptic Curve) achieves similar security with smaller keys. SSL/TLS uses hybrid approach: asymmetric encryption to exchange a symmetric key, then symmetric encryption (faster) for data transfer. Quantum computing threatens RSA/ECC, leading to post-quantum cryptography research.\n\n**Rubric:** Grade for Technical Depth and Clarity: Does the response provide deep, clear technical explanation?\n\n**Evaluation:**\nScore: 5/5\n\nReasoning: Outstanding explanation covering principles, process, underlying mathematics, applications, algorithms, real-world usage, and future considerations.

    "text": "You are an AI Judge. Evaluate the following response based on the rubric and provide a score from 1-5 and detailed reasoning.\n\n**Prompt:** What is the event loop in JavaScript and how does async/await work?\n\n**Response:** JavaScript is single-threaded but handles asynchronous operations via the event loop. The event loop continuously checks the call stack and task queues: 1) Call stack: Executes synchronous code. 2) Web APIs: Handle async operations (setTimeout, fetch, etc.) in browser. 3) Task queues: Microtask queue (promises, queueMicrotask—higher priority) and macrotask queue (setTimeout, setInterval). 4) Event loop: When call stack is empty, pulls from microtask queue first (until empty), then one macrotask, then repeats. Async/await is syntactic sugar over promises: 'async' functions always return promises; 'await' pauses execution until promise resolves, then resumes with the result. Behind the scenes, code after 'await' is wrapped in a .then() callback. Example: 'await fetch()' pauses the function, fetch runs in Web API, when complete it enters microtask queue, event loop resumes function execution. Benefits: Makes asynchronous code look synchronous, easier error handling with try/catch. Common mistake: forgetting 'await' returns a promise that must be awaited. This non-blocking architecture enables JavaScript's efficient handling of I/O-heavy operations despite being single-threaded.\n\n**Rubric:** Grade for Technical Completeness: Does the response thoroughly explain the technical concept?\n\n**Evaluation:**\nScore: 5/5\n\nReasoning: Exceptional technical explanation covering the event loop mechanism, queue priorities, async/await syntax and implementation, practical examples, benefits, common mistakes, and architectural implications.
